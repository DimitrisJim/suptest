### Pending

Some small procedural macros.

#### TODO/NOTES:

 - Todo: Preserve attributes for `mod`.
 - Note:Implement for crate level? (I feel it might become kind of obscure.)
 - Note: `#[ignore]` on module level?
 - Note: cfg(test): does it take attributes?
 - Todo: Can generalize the functions to just carry an attribute along.
 - Note: Does syn features full affect others?
